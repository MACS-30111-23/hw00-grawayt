## About Me
Hi! My name is Grace and I am from San Francisco. I just graduated from UChicago with a BA in Law, Letters and Society and am excited to start MACSS this fall. For most of college, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer. I wrote my BA thesis on the financial incentives for electric vehicle owners to sell energy from their car batteries to the utility during heat waves in order to avoid blackouts. As I was working on this project, I realized there were certain questions that I *wanted* to ask but needed computational skills in order to properly answer, so I decdided to apply to this program. 

Outside of school, I enjoy:
* Reading (espeically **sci-fi**)
* Baking
* Running

## Workflow for this homework
I started by cloning the assignment and putting it in the correct directory on my laptop, opening the file in VS Code, answering each question, and looking online when I didn't know how to do something. After I was done, I commited and pushed the changes to git. Going in, I knew how to create headings and lists, and put words in **bold** or *italics* becasue we went over it in the bootcamp but, before this assignment, I didn't know how to add an image to markdown! I also learned how to add links in different formats.
